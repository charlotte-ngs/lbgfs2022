## Disclaimer

This document is a first test for using quarto to write texts.

## Experiences

### Editor

The editor allows for two different modes

1.  Source: seams to be what was known from before
2.  Visual: more WYSIWYG-type of editor, except for the code chunks. The input of text-formatting elements seam to be comparable to before, hence titles can also be entered by hash-symbols, number and un-numbered lists by number followed by a dot and using the asterisk at the beginning of each line.

### Code Chunks

The syntax for the code chunks changed such that options are now inside of the code chunk starting with "#\|" which is most likely borrows from the yaml syntax.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Plotting

Plots are created by

```{r}
plot(mtcars)
```
