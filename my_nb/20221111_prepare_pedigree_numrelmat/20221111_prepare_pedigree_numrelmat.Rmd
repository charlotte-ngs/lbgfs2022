The following prepares the pedigree data for lbg_ex07. 

The file where the data should be written is given by

```{r}
s_ped_data <- file.path(here::here(), "docs", "data", "ped_num_rel_mat.csv")
```

The pedigree is defined as

```{r}
nr_animal <- 6
tbl_pedigree <- tibble::tibble(Calf = c(1:nr_animal),
                               Sire = c(NA, NA, NA, 1 ,3, 4),
                               Dam = c(NA, NA, NA, 2, 2, 5))
knitr::kable(tbl_pedigree, booktabs = TRUE, longtable = TRUE)
```

If the file does not exist, it is written to a file

```{r}
if (!file.exists(s_ped_data))
  readr::write_delim(tbl_pedigree, file = s_ped_data, delim = ";")
```
